# Welcome to Antibi Incorporated

Welcome to Antibi Incorporated. In order for our corporation to truly thrive. We need as many people to work four our corporation as possible. We have dispatched different hybrids across the country. While the hybrids think they are simply enjoying life on the road, we are always watching them and the people they talk to, learning about their desires and insecurities. Join Antibi now, and report on the Hybrids you are tracking, the people they meet, the places they, and the motorhomes they travel on.
